MOTHERBASE 

Motherbase is an IoT project. Kind of like a lot of other IoT projects.

Actually...it's exactly like a lot of other IoT projects, just a little worse. 

This was and still is a learning platform for me. It is based on Raspberry 3 and Pi Zero W hardware with 12 V relay switches 
and LED lights though it is designed to interface with any 12 V powered device easily. 

 Current Build:
  - Light control Via Tkinter GUI running on Raspbian
