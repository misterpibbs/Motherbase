MOTHERBASE 

Motherbase is an IoT project. Kind of like a lot of other IoT projects.

Actually...it's exactly like a lot of other IoT projects, just a little worse (lol). 

This was and still is a learning platform for me. It is based on Raspberry 3 and Pi Zero W hardware with 12 V relay switches 
and LED lights though it is designed to interface with any 12 V powered device easily. 

A Raspi Zero W acts as the server receiving commands from the Raspi 3 client. The Zero W being 'FOB' with Raspi 3 being 
'Motherbase'

Current Build:
 - Light control Via Tkinter GUI running on Raspbian
